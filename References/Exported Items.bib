	abstract = {This paper presents an approach to detect and solve the kidnapped robot problem using range data from a laser range ﬁnder and wiﬁ signals. Localization based on range ﬁnders has high accuracy, but fails to detect the kidnapped robot problem, a situation where a well-localized robot is moved to a random location without itself noticing about it. On the other hand, localization based on wiﬁ signals has very high reliability and can be used to detect the occurrence of the kidnapped robot problem; but lacks accuracy. In our approach, a probability density function is constructed using particles sampled from the wiﬁ signal models using kernel density estimation, then the likelihood of every laser range ﬁnder particle with respect to the constructed probability density function is calculated. The mobile robot reset its localization process if these probabilities are too low.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new method to detect the kidnapped robot problem event in Monte Carlo Localization. The method is designed such that it can provide accurate detection in wide range of particles' convergence level and does not depend too much on the re-Iocalization/recovery process. The proposed method combines the difference in particle's weight, maximum current weight, and difference in particles' standard deviation. The addition of these two parameters is believed to be superior to a pure maximum current weight parameter for kidnapping detection. A series of simulation tests are executed to prove it. These simulations show that the proposed method outperforms the maximum current weight parameter in terms of accuracy, ability to detect kidnapping during early stage of localization, and independency towards the success of the re-Iocalization process.},

	abstract = {The range-only simultaneous localization and mapping ({RO}-{SLAM}) problem is considered in this article. This is a difﬁcult problem since bearing measurements are not available. Also, the frequent outliers induced by the sensor nature (typically sonar or radio pulses) render the {RO}-{SLAM} problem more challenging. The non-Gaussian distribution found in the {RO}-{SLAM} problem makes that the landmarks cannot be directly updated using the approach based on the Gaussian assumption. We propose a region-based particle ﬁlter and a proper likelihood model to realize the reduction of particle numbers and allow the introduction of new landmarks without delayed processing. A transition mode is designed from the loosely coupled way to the tightly coupled way and used to estimate the pose of the robot and locations of landmarks. Furthermore, two detection methods are, respectively, used to remove the outliers generated by the range-only sensors according to the distribution status of the landmark estimation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through simulations and experiments with a range-only sensor, i.e., Ultrawideband ({UWB}). Furthermore, the obtained results are compared with the classical algorithm. The simulation and experiment results verify the validity and superiority of the proposed {RO}-{SLAM} algorithm.},

	abstract = {This paper demonstrates an effective method for combining measurements from a gyroscope and rotary wheel encoders (odometry) in mobile robot localization. Sensor fusion of this kind is done using an Extended Kalman filter obtained from the values of above sensors for a mobile autonomous robot. Many such methods implement a statistical model that describes the behaviour of the gyroscope and the odometry component. However, because these systems are based on models, they cannot anticipate the unpredictable and potentially "catastrophic" effects of irregularities and frictional changes occasionally encountered on the floor. We present experimental evidence that non-systematic odometry error sources impact the robot’s motion. Therefore a new approach has been developed based on a study of the physical interaction between ground and the robot. This approach has been implemented by developing an embedded system with {ARM} 7 based {LPC}2148 micro-controller. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively reduces the localization error while yielding feasible parameter estimation.},

Achieving the target precisely in any environment is not an easy task since there are noises and obstacles in the surrounding environment. Therefore, filtering the signals to reduce noises is essential for more accurate and precise motion. In this paper, we selected the extended Kalman filter, which is used for non-linear models’ signals to predict the coordinates of a wheeled mobile robot. We tested the efficiency of this filter under three noise cases: no noise, Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian noise using {MATLAB} software.},

	abstract = {We present a solution for the global localization of a mobile robot which disposes of a prior map and is waked up in an unknown position. This case is known in robotics as the kidnapped robot problem. The algorithm is based on the adaptation of the 2D {SURF} (Speeded Up Robust Features) image features to 3D landmarks of the environment. In this way the prior map is built, containing only 3D Surf landmarks. When the robot wakes up in an unknown location the robot starts to search after these landmarks, which are compared to the priory known ones based on the {SURF} descriptors. To estimate the displacement between the online and offline landmarks the {RANSAC} random sampling method is used. This method also has the advantage that the falsely detected and associated landmarks are eliminated. The experiments were carried out in an indoor office environment.},

Using contraction theory, we provide convergence analysis of the proposed range-only bearing estimator and present upper and lower-bound for the estimator gain.
